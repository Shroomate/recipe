# Miso Chicken

## Miso Chicken Ingredients
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 3 tbsp white miso paste
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp honey or maple syrup
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 green onions, sliced (for garnish)
- Sesame seeds (optional, for garnish)

## Preparation Steps
1. **Make marinade**: In a bowl, whisk together miso paste, soy sauce, rice vinegar, honey, garlic, ginger, and sesame oil.
2. **Marinate chicken**: Coat chicken thighs in the marinade and let sit for at least 30 minutes (up to 4 hours) in the fridge.
3. **Cook chicken**: Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Place chicken on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20-25 minutes until cooked through and slightly caramelized.
4. **Serve**: Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds. Great with steamed rice and sautéed veggies.

## Notes
- For extra flavor, grill the chicken instead of baking.
- Use red miso for a deeper, more intense miso flavor.
