# Classic Pork Carnitas

## Classic Pork Carnitas Ingredients
- 3 lbs pork shoulder, cut into 2-inch cubes
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 orange, juiced and zested
- 1 lime, juiced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup chicken broth
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil

## Preparation Steps
1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C).
2. **Season Pork**: In a large bowl, toss pork cubes with salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano.
3. **Brown Pork**: Heat oil in a heavy oven-safe pot over medium-high heat. Brown pork in batches until golden brown on all sides.
4. **Combine Ingredients**: Return all pork to pot. Add minced garlic, orange juice and zest, lime juice, bay leaves, and chicken broth.
5. **Slow Cook**: Cover pot with a lid and transfer to oven. Cook for 2.5 to 3 hours until pork is tender and easily shredded.
6. **Shred Pork**: Remove pork from pot and shred using two forks.
7. **Optional Crisping**: Optional: Spread shredded pork on a baking sheet and broil for 5-7 minutes to crisp edges.
8. **Serve**: Serve warm with tortillas, salsa, and your choice of toppings.

## Notes
- Slow roasting tenderizes the pork and infuses it with citrus flavor. For a quicker option, use a slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours.
- Serve with warm tortillas, fresh salsa, guacamole, or pickled onions for an authentic Mexican meal.
