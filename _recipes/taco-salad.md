# Taco Salad

## Taco Salad Ingredients
- 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil
- 1 lb. ground sirloin beef
- 1 (1-oz.) package taco seasoning
- 15 oz. can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 head romaine lettuce, chopped
- 1 cup grated cheddar cheese
- 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes
- 1 avocado, diced
- 1/2 cup sliced red onion
- 1/4 cup chopped cilantro leaves

## Side Dish Ingredients
- Tortilla chips and sour cream, for serving
- Thinly sliced jalapeño or hot sauce (optional)

## Preparation Steps
1. **Cook the beef**: In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook for 6 to 7 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon. Add 2/3 cup of water and the taco seasoning. Stir well to combine.
2. **Warm the beans**: Add the black beans and stir gently to combine. Cook until the beans are warmed through, about 3 minutes.
3. **Prepare the salad bowls**: Divide the lettuce among serving bowls. Top with grated cheese, the beef mixture, tomatoes, avocado, onion, and cilantro.
4. **Add lime and toppings**: Squeeze a lime half all over each salad, then dollop with sour cream. Top with fresh jalapeño slices or a dash of hot sauce, if desired.
5. **Serve**: Serve with tortilla chips.

## Notes
- Ground sirloin is great for this recipe. Its lower fat content keeps excess oil out of your skillet, but any type of ground beef will work!
