# Cassoulet (French Meat & Bean Stew)

## Cassoulet (French Meat & Bean Stew) Ingredients
- 1 lb dried white beans (Great Northern or white kidney beans)
- Salt for soaking water
- 4 oz salt pork, country ham, or bacon (cut into lardons)
- 4 fresh sausages (e.g., pork or chicken)
- 2 chicken legs (or duck confit, if available)
- Optional: additional scraps of meat
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 celery stalks, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 4–6 garlic cloves, minced
- Duck fat, butter, or oil (as needed for browning)
- 1–2 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 bouillon cubes (or 4 cups meat stock)
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- Optional: a pinch of ground cloves
- Black pepper (generous amount)
- Salt (as needed)
- 1 packet unflavored gelatin (about 1 tbsp)

## Side Dish Ingredients
- Breadcrumbs for final oven crisp

## Preparation Steps
1. **Soak the beans**: Preferably overnight in heavily salted water, or boil and soak for 1 hour.
2. **Brown the meats**: Render fat from salt pork or ham, brown sausages and chicken legs, keep all meat in pot.
3. **Add vegetables**: Sauté carrots, add celery and onion to deglaze, then garlic and tomato paste.
4. **Add beans and liquid**: Rinse beans, add to pot with water or stock, add bouillon, herbs, but no salt yet.
5. **Simmer on stovetop**: Simmer on stovetop about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
6. **Add gelatin**: Add gelatin dissolved in cold water to hot stew.
7. **Bake the stew**: Bake at 300ºF (150ºC) uncovered for 2+ hours, optionally break crust and add water if dry.
8. **Add breadcrumbs and brown**: Add optional breadcrumbs and broil or bake to brown.

## Notes
- Use heavily salted water for soaking beans to enhance flavor and texture.
- If you don't have gelatin, you can omit it but the stew may be less thick.
- Serve cassoulet with a green salad or crusty French bread for a classic combination.
