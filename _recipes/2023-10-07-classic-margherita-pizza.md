# Classic Margherita Pizza

## Classic Margherita Pizza Ingredients
- 1 pizza dough ball (about 12 inches)
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 8 oz fresh mozzarella, sliced
- Fresh basil leaves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt to taste

## Preparation Steps
1. **Preheat oven and prepare dough**: Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). On a floured surface, roll out pizza dough to a 12-inch circle.
2. **Add toppings**: Spread tomato sauce evenly over dough, leaving a small border. Arrange mozzarella slices on top of sauce.
3. **Bake pizza**: Bake pizza in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly.
4. **Finish and serve**: Remove from oven, top with fresh basil leaves, drizzle olive oil, and sprinkle salt to taste. Slice and serve hot.

## Notes
- For a crispier crust, preheat a pizza stone in the oven before baking.
